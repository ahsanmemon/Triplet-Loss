# Triplet-Loss
My efforts to understand and implement the Triplet Loss Function<br>
Next steps include creating the online triplet loss function. Already done with a part of the notebook. Lets hope I can gather up the energy to finish it off. 

Later than that, I plan on implementing the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10467">Generalized End-to-End Loss</a>
